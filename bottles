99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. 
Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall...

Create a program that prints out every line to the song "99 bottles of beer on the wall."
Do not use a list for all of the numbers, and do not manually type them all in. Use a built in function instead.
Besides the phrase "take one down," you may not type in any numbers/names of numbers directly into your song lyrics.
Remember, when you reach 1 bottle left, the word "bottles" becomes singular.
